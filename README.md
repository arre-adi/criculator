# Cricket Calculator

Hey there! Welcome to my quirky little calculator app with a cricket twist.

## What's this all about?

So, I had this idea - why not mix cricket with a calculator? Weird, right? But hear me out. It's a normal calculator, but with a fun surprise. Type in your favorite cricket player's jersey number, hit equals, and see what happens!

## Cool stuff you can do

- Use it as a regular calculator (you know, for math and stuff)
- Find some cricket-themed surprises
- Maybe hear a thing or two when you punch in certain numbers (hint: think jersey numbers)

## Want to try it out?

Great! Just grab the APK from this link: [Download Cricket Calculator APK](https://your-download-link-here.com)

Once you've got it, just install it on your Android phone and you're good to go!

## For the curious cats (aka tech stuff)

If you're into the nitty-gritty, here's what I used to build this:

- Android Studio (because, well, it's an Android app)
- Kotlin (it's like Java, but cooler)
- XML (for making things look pretty)

</div>

## Want to make it even better?

Feel free to tinker with it! Add more sounds, throw in some new cricket facts, or whatever you think would be fun. If you come up with something cool, let me know!
