# Cricket Calculator

Hey there! Welcome to my calculator app with a cricket twist.

## What's this all about?

I had this idea - why not mix cricket with a calculator? Weird, right? 
It's a normal calculator, but with a fun surprise. Type in your favorite cricket player's jersey number, hit equals, and see what happens!

## Cool stuff you can do

- Use it as a regular calculator 
- Maybe hear a thing or two when you punch in certain numbers (hint: think jersey numbers)

## Want to try it out?

Great! Just grab the APK from this link: [Download Cricket Calculator APK](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BWJ6JyQX7le0sn3isJMG-IM_K3BBEZ6S?usp=drive_link)

Once you've got it, just install it on your Android phone and you're good to go!

## Tech used

If you're into the nitty-gritty, here's what I used to build this:

- Android Studio
- Kotlin
- XML

## Want to make it even better?

Feel free to tinker with it! Add more sounds, throw in some new cricket facts, or whatever you think would be fun. If you come up with something cool, let me know!
